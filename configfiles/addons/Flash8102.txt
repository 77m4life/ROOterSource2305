Flashing the ZBT Z8102AX
========================

Note : due to problems with the WAN port the WAN has been moved
	from the correct WAN port to the Ethernet port to it's left.
	This leaves 3 Ethernet ports and a working WAN port.
	See wan8102.jpg for details.

To flash from factory to ROOter go to the System->Backup/Flash
menu and flash from there.

Be sure to deselect Keep Settings and select Force Flash.
